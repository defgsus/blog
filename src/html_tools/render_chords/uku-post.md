Hey! I started playing ukulele a while ago and somehow i got away from the computer during most of the year. How is this even possible? Certainly, the standard ukulele tuning would not have helped me to break my programming habit:

```chords-G4/-7/4/5
"default" ukulele tuning: 0/0/0/0
```

(You can click on the notes or the chord tab to play it)

For some reason, the ukulele has a high **G**-string where i would expect a bass string. Represented by a root note and intervals from one string to the next, the standard ukulele tuning could be called **G,-7,4,5**.

I used another thick **C**-string to replace the high **G** with an octave deeper and the tuning became **G,5,4,5**:  

```chords-G/5/4/5
"G545" tuning: 0/0/0/0
```

The deep **G** sounds quite nice, a bit banjo-esque even, but the string was too loose on my instrument and the pitch bent too much when fingered, so i shifted all strings one tone up, except the highest: 

```chords-A/5/4/3
My "A543" tuning: 0/0/0/0
```

It's a **D major** with a bass **A**. And this effectively kept me away from laptop and instead led to countless hours of playing. Below is a small collection of songs that came to life during this year. They have been recorded with a BOSS BR80, a little multi-track recorder with nice microphones and effects. Some recordings also have bass or percussion, some have 3 ukulele tracks and even a bit of mandolin. It's basically just ideas that can get better when played together. There is not much of an arrangement. Mostly the parts are played three or four times in a loop.

That's the first piece that i recorded. Then developed it a bit further, recorded again, aso. It's fun to play it solo as well.

The numbers show the current bar for each chord. All songs are 4/4 time unless noted otherwise. Some *'special'* chords have been suffixed with **x**, **y** or **2** or something like that. I'm not really able to tell the official name in all cases. The tabs for the chords are listed in order of appearance below the bars.

One of the first records. I did have trouble with the **F#m** and other chords then, but trying to record the song helped. Not to play them good but at least in time. It's a nice solo piece that i practiced a lot for a while.

An idea developed with a friend called Pepe, but it's on D, not on P. An easy piece and good for singing a 60ies melody on top.

A very simple piece, but it has some merry drive. At that time, i began to realize that most of my new songs are good-tempered. 

You need to do a bit of fingering in the verse that is not written down, but it's easy to find out.

```chords-A/5/4/3

{audio:phrygian.mp3}

Here i wrote down a specific scale that i sometimes played on the piano. I remember it being called "Phrygian" but nowadays i can not find the exact scale written down somewhere. There are very similar ones listed as "Phrygian", though. The intervals are **0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10**. Rooted on **A**, the scale looks like this on the A543 tuning:

```
    A   |-------|--B  --|--C  --|-------|-------|--D# --|--E  --|-------|--F# --|--G  --|-------|--A  --|
    F#  |--G  --|-------|--A  --|-------|--B  --|--C  --|-------|-------|--D# --|--E  --|-------|--F# --|
        |--D# --|--E  --|-------|--F# --|--G  --|-------|--A  --|-------|--B  --|--C  --|-------|-------|
    A   |-------|--B  --|--C  --|-------|-------|--D# --|--E  --|-------|--F# --|--G  --|-------|--A  --|
```

It 'contains' the chords **B**, **Em**, **Am** and **C**. So when only playing these chords, the scale does always fit. I missed it once or twice in the recording but that's covered by creative freedom. It reminds me of *Flamenco* and a bit *Santana*. It's fun to practice the above scale on different combinations of the chords. The recording is based on **Em B Am B**. Also try the more folky/union-ish **Em Am Em B** or a story-telling **Am B Em**.

```chords-A/5/4/3
B: 2/1/0/2

A riff that i also like practicing twice as fast ;) There is even a bit of arrangement in here and a solo at the end. Unfortunately, on the 1st ukulele track i did forget to come back to the chorus once more and so it ends in shards. (I've not yet used to come to the habit of recording pieces of a song separately.)

A melancholic little piece on the swinging seat in the garden with a lot of raindrops on ukulele and drum channels. Sounds nice but was unpleasantly wet at times.

Funky with a little Beatles-like harmonic drift. The last part just came up during recording and is badly played, but it remained for reference.

The harmonics have a nice drift and need the lead voice on top. One can whistle them when playing. I was insanely happy with the record, although there are still a lot of *bad notes*. I also spent a bit more time than usual for the bass and percussion and [skipped kindergarten](https://github.com/defgsus/kindergarten-times/commit/65c5d05ccc58d252eabc3995447b10957e44f358) the next day.

Both recordings are based on the same chords. The lyrics are picked more or less randomly from an old book. They are from [The H-Bomb's Thunder](https://unionsong.com/u576.html) by John Brunner, written for the *Aldermaston March* in 1958. 

The important thing is the rhythmic tapping/release of the lowest string in the **open B** chord in the beginning. And a nice overdrive ;)

In the 90ies, *David Hasselhoff* had a huge commercial success with ["Looking for Freedom"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looking_for_Freedom_(song)). It's been written earlier though, and it also had not much to do with the Fall of the Wall in the GDR, although the beloved Hasselhoff played it in Berlin at that time. It's actually the story of a young boy who is just too rich to be free. This is also not clear in the official german version "Auf der Straße nach Süden". So here is my personal translation. I also added a **C minor** because that makes it sound a bit like an early *Udo Lindenberg* piece, and he also played in Berlin ;)

Finally, an interpretation of ["My Old Kentucky Home"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Old_Kentucky_Home), written by Stephen Foster in the 1850's and inspired by [Uncle Tom's Cabin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Tom%27s_Cabin).

Just found it in a book and somehow fell in love with the chords and the melody that came from it. I did not listen to other recordings of it, yet, and i can not really read sheet music. And i tried to sing it a bit higher and failed painfully. Certainly worth more practice.
