Hey! I started playing ukulele a while ago and somehow i got away from the computer during most of the year. How is this even possible? Certainly, the standard ukulele tuning would not have helped me to break my program-the-whole-day habit:

```chords-G4/-7/4/5
"default" ukulele tuning: 0/0/0/0
```

(You can click on the notes or the chord tab to play it)

For some reason, the ukulele has a high **G**-string where i would expect a bass string. Represented by a root note and intervals from one string to the next, the standard ukulele tuning could be called **G,-7,4,5**.

I used another thick **C**-string to replace the high **G** with an octave deeper and the tuning became **G,5,4,5**:  

```chords-G/5/4/5
"G545" tuning: 0/0/0/0
```

The deep **G** sounds quite nice, a bit banjo-esque even, but the string was too loose on my instrument and the pitch bent too much when fingered, so i shifted all strings one tone up, except the highest: 

```chords-A/5/4/3
0/0/0/0
```

It's a **D major** with an **A** in the bass. And this effectively kept me away from laptop and instead led to countless hours of playing. Below is a small collection of songs that came to life during this year. They have been recorded with a BOSS BR80, a little multi-track recorder with nice microphones and effects. Some recordings also have bass or percussion, some have 3 ukulele tracks and even a bit of mandolin. It's basically just ideas that can get better when played together. There is no arrangement. Mostly the parts are just played three or four times in a loop.

The numbers show the current bar for each chord. Some *'special'* chords have been suffixed with **x**, **y** or **2** or something like that. I'm not really able to tell the official name in all cases. The tabs for the chords are listed in order of appearance below the bars.

A melancholic little piece on the swinging seat in the garden with a lot of raindrops on ukulele and drum channels. Sounds nice but was unpleasantly wet at times.

Both recordings are based on the same chords. The lyrics are picked more or less randomly from an old book. They are from [The H-Bomb's Thunder](https://unionsong.com/u576.html) by John Brunner, written for the *Aldermaston March* in 1958.
