So jekyll wants me to add an *about page*. 

I used to be a free-lance programmer (as in *free of regular income*) for 
quite a while and did some excellent stuff for planetarium audio-visual 
systems, a.k.a. **fulldome**. 

Now i undergo the more well-known adventures of family, 
programming-for-a-living, sleep deprivation and the change 
of the internet into a gigantic pile of marketing excrement.
